# CATALOG DESCRIPTION
CSCI 40: Programming Concepts and Methodology in C++, 4 units, 3 hours lecture,
2 hours laboratory per week.

Prerequisite: 	Math 3 (Intermediate Algebra) or equivalent.

Advisory: 	Eligibility for English 125 and 126 or English 153 or ESL 167 and 168
recommended.

Introduction to problem solving, algorithm development, procedural and data abstraction using high level computer programming language C++; program design, coding, debugging, testing, and documentation.

# OBJECTIVE
	**Upon successful completion of the course, the student will be able to:**
* Analyze a problem and decide whether or not it would be useful to use a computer     program for the problem solving;
* Develop algorithm for the solution of the problem;
* Write and execute a computer program that implements the algorithm;
* Use proper programming style, debugging, and testing techniques;
* Use looping structures in programs;
* Use control structures in programs;
* Use primary data types in programs such as int, double, float, and char;
* Use basic data structure such as arrays and linked lists;
* Write programs that handle strings of characters;
* Define a class or class template to solve programming problems.
# COURSE WORK
	**Course work consists of:**
* Programming Assignments;
* Midterm exams and a final exam. The final exam is comprehensive;
* Lab tests (Programming tests)
# TEACHING PLAN (tentative)
**The course is roughly divided into four sections and will cover the first 14 chapters of the text. Topics covered by each section are listed as following:**
* Section 1:  	Chapter 1 - Chapter 4 (week 1 – week 4)
  Introduce computer and computer programming; Discuss primitive data types and operations; Study selection and looping statements.		
* Section 2:  	Chapter 5 – Chapter 8 (week 5 – week 8)
	Functions; Arrays; Pointer and C-Strings; Recursion
* Section 3:  	Chapter 9 – Chapter 12 (week 9 – week 12)
	Objects and classes; Inheritance and polymorphism;
* Section 4:	Chapter 13 – Chapter 14 (week 13 – week 16)
	File input and output; Operator overloading; Exception Handling;
	Linked Lists.
